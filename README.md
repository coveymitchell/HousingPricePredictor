# Housing Price Predictor
This was my final for a course I took on deep learning. We were given a dataset related to boston housing prices and were asked to write a model to predict the price of boston houses using deep learning. Our findings were then recorded inside a paper included in this repository. The project experimented with different network structures and optimization algorithms to try to improve the model's performance. The evaluation metric used was the mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). From the results, the best performing network structure was a three-layer neural network with 200, 100, and 50 neurons, using the Relu activation function and the Adam optimization algorithm, which had an MSE of 0.003803374818150412 and a RMSE of 0.006229763007048005. It is also worth noting that the Adam optimization algorithm consistently performed well across different network structures.
